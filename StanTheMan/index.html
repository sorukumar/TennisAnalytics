                <p>These visualizations highlight the rarity of late-career Grand Slam breakthroughs in tennis. While most champions secure their first major title 
                in their early to mid-twenties, players like Stan Wawrinka and Goran Ivanisevic demonstrate that perseverance can eventually lead to Grand Slam success.</p>
                <p>Their achievements are particularly remarkable given the physical demands of tennis and the dominance of younger players in the sport.</p>
