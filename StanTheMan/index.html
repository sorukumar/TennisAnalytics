            <h2>Age Distribution of First Grand Slam Wins</h2>
            <p>90% of players win their first Grand Slam before the age of 27, with 50% achieving this milestone before turning 23.</p>
            <p>All-time greats (5+ Grand Slam titles) have typically won their first Grand Slam before turning 22—except for Ivan Lendl, and perhaps Jannik Sinner in the future.</p>
            <p>Stan Wawrinka stands out as the only player with over 10 years on tour and 500+ matches who went on to win 3 Grand Slam titles. A legend in his own right.</p>

            <p>For most players, it takes 2-5 years on tour to mature and win their first Grand Slam.</p>
            <p>However, players like Goran Ivanišević (13 years), Andrés Gómez (12 years), and Stan Wawrinka (11 years) defied the odds, achieving Grand Slam success after more than a decade of perseverance.</p>

            <h2>Age vs Experience at First Grand Slam Win</h2>
            <p>If a player hasn’t won a Grand Slam by the age of 22, their chances of winning one drop significantly, and the likelihood of winning multiple Grand Slams becomes almost zero.</p>
            <p>Players like Stan Wawrinka, Goran Ivanišević, Petr Korda, Andrés Gómez, and Thomas Muster are examples of those who faced setbacks but made remarkable comebacks to achieve Grand Slam glory.</p>

            <p>Stan Wawrinka is a unique case: over 10 years on tour, 500+ matches, and a career-high ranking of 8, yet he went on to win 3 Grand Slam titles. Truly a legend in his own right.</p>
            <p>Goran Ivanišević’s Grand Slam victory remains one of the most celebrated achievements in tennis history, a testament to perseverance and determination.</p>
