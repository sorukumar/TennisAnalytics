                <h3>Why Tennis is One of the Most Brutal Sports</h3>
                <p>These visualizations demonstrate why professional tennis is considered one of the most challenging sports to succeed in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extreme concentration of success among a tiny elite</li>
                    <li>Short career spans for the majority of players</li>
                    <li>Winner-takes-all economics that rewards only the very top performers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While the sport appears glamorous at the top level, the data reveals a much harsher reality for the vast majority of professional players.</p>
